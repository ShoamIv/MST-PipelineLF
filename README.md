# MST-PipelineLF
efficiently calculates Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) on large graphs using a pipeline and LF architecture combined with lock-free techniques. This project is optimized for performance, minimizing contention and enhancing parallel processing, making it ideal for applications like network design, clustering, and real-time graph analysis.
