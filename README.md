**Project Overview** 
This project is an advanced Operating Systems assignment that implements a concurrent, client-server system to compute Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) on weighted, directed graphs. It supports multiple MST algorithms, leverages both Pipeline (Active Object) and Leader-Follower (LF) concurrency models, and includes analysis tools using Valgrind and code coverage utilities.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies: C++, POSIX Threads, Strategy/Factory Design Patterns, Active Object, Leader-Follower Thread Pool, Valgrind, Graph Theory.
